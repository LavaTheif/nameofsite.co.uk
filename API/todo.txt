request page /API/endpoints/*.json
get headers, needs username, id and token where token is the login token for the account.

if all data matches, then query the database and return the valid JSON data.  if there is an error, return invalid.json.

build pages with JS??? maybe add the taskbar to the initPage.js

init.js --> get user data, which checks if the login is valid.
	--> load users boards

--> allow users to select a board, and get the board data.


--> we need to make a post function under the get function to save data to the db

--> should we have a seperate screen for when there is no board selected? This could also be used to change the current board


|select board|					|
